## How to run the project

On a terminal, under project root folder, run the following command:

```shell script
./mvnw compile quarkus:dev
```

If you want to build an _Ã¼ber-jar_, execute the following command:

```shell script
./mvnw package '-Dquarkus.package.type=uber-jar'
```

The application is now runnable using `java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar`.

## Build Docker image

```shell script
./mvnw clean package '-Dquarkus.container-image.build=true'
```

Open a browser and navigate to:

```text

```

Use the interactive swagger interface to execute the web service.

## How to test the project

Simply use the IDE to run a test, or don't maven skip them.

Notice that tests are re-testing things just for noticing that environment is fully set on every layer.
Real life tests should implement mocking.
